## Abstract
> We propose a new dataset, HabitatDyn, which includes synthetic RGB videos, semantic labels, and depth information, as well as kinetics information. The dataset features 30 scenes from the perspective of a mobile robot with a moving camera, and contains six different types of moving objects with varying velocities.

## Overview

We use of the [Facebook AI Habitat simulation platform](https://github.com/facebookresearch/habitat-sim) as a basic set-up with embodied agents in 3D
virtual environments for generating desired data. We made a configuration API on top of the AI habitat simulator to performe dataset generate our HabitatDyn dataset, including camera adjustment, annotation recording, random pathfinding abd embodied agents navigation in the simulated scene.

HabitatDyn contains 1590 high-quality videos for 30 meticulously curated scenes from [HM3D](https://aihabitat.org/datasets/hm3d/, citation down below). These scenes feature free, randomly placed object models sourced from the Internet. To add a touch of realism and dynamism, 3 or 6 moving object instances from each model are randomly dropped into the scene, and a robot agent equipped with a camera is also present to capture the scene in detail (camera specifications can be found in the dataset). The videos come with RGB, depth, and semantic annotations, ensuring that researchers have access to a wealth of information for their projects.

Additionally, the objects in each scene have been carefully programmed to move at varying speeds, with 3 levels of movement speed available (1 m/s, 2 m/s, and 3 m/s). To add even more depth to the dataset, each scene has been split into "incl_static" and "excl_static" versions. In the "incl_static" version, 10 static extra object models are randomly placed in the scene, while in the "excl_static" version, only the original objects from the scene and moving instances are present.

Furthermore, the same settings for 3 randomly chosen instances from the 6 models are also generated, making this dataset a comprehensive and versatile resource for researchers in various fields.

In the entirety of the video recording, data pertaining to the physical properties such as the specifications of the camera, as well as the positional information of both the camera itself and any pedestrians or moving objects present within the recording are documented.
